# Lighthouse Labs: Midterm Project

Project Vienna
-----

An iOS application to demonstrate Geofencing.  Alerts will be generated when 
the user is within a certain distance of an attraction within a city.  The 
user is given a list of attractions from which they will select favourites.  
The user can select an alert distance (defaults to 1km) and when they are
within the designated distance the application will either play a sound if 
it is in the foreground or issue a local notification from the background.


Learning goals:
- demonstrate the ability to build an application UI with various screens
the user can navigate, including a table view controller, a map view, and 
a tab view controller.
- manipulate the map view with annotations that the user can interact with
- use Google Map APIs to find locations of interest to the user
- use Core Data for local caching of data from the API, and to generate the
data model used in the application
- use Geofencing to trigger application events based on the user's distance 
from a location's coordinates
